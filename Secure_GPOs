Disable LLMNR
Goto Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Network -> DNS Client
Click on “Turn Off Multicast Name Resolution” and set it to “Enabled”
Disable NetBios
You can’t disable netbios directly within group policy, but there are a few different ways that you can..
Via PowerShell-
$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}

Via registry settings
set-ItemProperty HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces\tcpip* -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2
The best option might be utilizing DHCP when address is assigned to interface.

Disable/Configure WPAD
To disable WPAD you must turn off the automatic proxy configuration settings option in Internet Explorer
In group policy, expend User Configuration>Administrative Templates>Windows Components>Internet Explorer>Disable changing Automatic Configuration settings
Another option is to configure WPAD, as this will make poisoning the entry impossible.
Disable LM Hash
If you are running an older forest functional level the LMhash is an older hash that is easily cracked that stores AD credentials which you can turn off using group policy.
In Group Policy, expand Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Local Policies>Security Options>Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change.
