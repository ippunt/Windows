Via PowerShell
Via registry settings

Disable/Configure WPAD
To disable WPAD you must turn off the automatic proxy configuration settings option in Internet Explorer
In group policy, expend User Configuration>Administrative Templates>Windows Components>Internet Explorer>Disable changing Automatic Configuration settings
Another option is to configure WPAD, as this will make poisoning the entry impossible.
Disable LM Hash
If you are running an older forest functional level the LMhash is an older hash that is easily cracked that stores AD credentials which you can turn off using group policy.
In Group Policy, expand Computer Configuration>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Local Policies>Security Options>Network security: Do not store LAN Manager hash value on next password change.
